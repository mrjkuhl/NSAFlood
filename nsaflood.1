creates a file of junk data read from /dev/urandom, and transmits it across networked computers. NSAFlood was made specifically to combat Internet surveillance, by transmitting large amounts of encrypted data across the Internet, which the United States National Security Agency (NSA) must copy and store in its entirety, indefinatily, as is their policy for all encrypted Internet traffic.
